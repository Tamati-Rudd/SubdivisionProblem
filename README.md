# SubdivisionProblem
Project where I had to use dynamic programming to determine the best way to subdivide a land plot to maximize value.

Given a (small) land plot, a table of prices and a subdivision cost, the program can determine how to subdivide the land to generate the most value using:
1. A brute force approach
2. A greedy technique approach
3. A dynamic programming approach

Created in Netbeans for a university assignment.
